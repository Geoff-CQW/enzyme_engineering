when trying to partial diffuse residues within 12A of substrate, partial diff at low levels 5-20, just 1 is enough, since structures are almost the same

from 20 onwards more variability, 35 onwards becomes barrel structure.




beta model for partial diffusion is useless, too much disordered regeions,

fold cond seems more promising, lots of unnecessary helices, maybe make shorter proteins. Fold conditioning only trained with default model, all others don't work. 

Try giving it a whole bunch of other proteins as input?

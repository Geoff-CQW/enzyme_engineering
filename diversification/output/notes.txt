when trying to partial diffuse residues within 12A of substrate, partial diff at low levels 5-20, just 1 is enough, since structures are almost the same

from 20 onwards more variability, 35 onwards becomes barrel structure.

To try: partial diff entire 7AUY, 20A of substrate.



beta model for partial diffusion is useless, too much disordered regeions,

fold cond seems more promising, lots of unnecessary helices, maybe make shorter proteins. 

Try giving it a whole bunch of other proteins as input?
